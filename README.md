# Project Name: Logistics Analysis

This project is used to demonstrate skills and knowledge gained through the course of #NG30DAYS OF LEARNING.

Problem Objectives:
To gain insights and possible recommendations from the available data.

# Data Sourcing;
The data used for this project was obtained on Github, check the link below 
https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/blob/main/KaggleCarData.csv

# Data Preparation
The dataset was converted into. XLSX format was stored in a secure worksheet.
i. Data formatting
ii. Data Trimming
iii. Fixing data type and typecasting.

# Data Visualization
The dataset was visualised using Power Bi software.

# Reports;
i. The total present_price,selling_price, and Kms_driven  of all cars in this dataset are 1.05 Billion, 0.98Billion and 3.55billion respectively.
ii.  The data shows data there are two classes of seller_type affecting present_price value ( dealer and Individual). The dealers represent 66% of the present_price while the individuals represent 34% present_price of all cars in the datasets.
iii. Another factor affecting the present_price is the transmission type ( Automatic and Manual).  The Automatic transmission type is 13.63% of the present_price( 142.46 Million )  while the automatic transmission type is 86.37% (903.02 million).
iv. There are 3 fuel_types( Petrol, Diesel and CNG) which are contributing factors to the present_price.  Petrol using care is 79.05% of the total present_price, Diesel using cars is 20.00% of the total present_price and CNG using cars is 0.95% of the total present_price.
v.  present_price and selling _price of cars decreased significantly in the year 2018 and 2007.
This decrease in price could be due to the following factors;
-Dealer as the only available seller_type.
-Unavailability of cars using automatic transmission type.
- Unavailability of cars using Petrol Fuel type.
